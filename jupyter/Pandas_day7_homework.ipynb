Photo Editor Kurt Mutchler and I worked with the Hotel Pennsylvania, the \"bedroom\" for all the dogs that are in New York City for the Westminster Dog Show. The approach was to set up a studio in one of the hotel\\'s dozens of ballrooms. We roamed around the lobby and hallways to look for dogs to come and have their portraits made. Leo was a wonderful Afghan to work with. At his studio appointment, everything was going well. Leo was like a professional model, beautiful and well behaved, as are a lot of show dogs. We were only a few minutes into the shoot when the door to the ballroom-studio was opened, and Leo saw an opportunity. I will never forget how fast he was as he headed out the door. The funny thing is that every Afghan I have photographed has taken the opportunity to run. I should have known better. It is just in their nature. That worked well with the title of the story, \"How to Build a Dog,\" and the idea that dogs have been transformed from a common ancestor, the gray wolf, into what man needs: a guard dog, a hunting partner, a guide dog, or a best friend.

For my first National Geographic magazine story, in January 2012, I spent 40 days on assignment, with 28 days dedicated to the journey itself. The objective was to walk up the frozen Wakhan River in Afghanistan, a winter trek to the Little Pamir plateau (14,000 ft/4,300 m) to document the challenging life of the Afghan-Kyrgyz community here. Although I was familiar with the region from over a decade of intermittent work, winter in the Pamir was uncharted territory for me. The last outsiders to navigate the frozen river did so in 1972, leaving little information about conditions. I was excited yet apprehensive, to say the least. Being a new father, with my son just 11 months, brought added worries—what if the ice broke under my weight? Like most things that are scary in your mind, once you actually live through them, you understand them and they even become your friends… These are images from my expedition “commute”—extraordinary times spent on the edge of the story. In these images: A caravan on its way to the lower valleys; sleeping in a cave next to a river canyon in minus 30 temps; entering the Wakhan River canyon; reaching one of the three high-altitude passes we needed to cross; a man drinks from a spring; passing a lone opium dealer; a caravan leader looks for water to make tea; winter shepherds offer us hospitality; a yak herd reaches the plateau after a snowstorm; and sharing work with a Kyrgyz woman and her kids.Go to the link in bio to see the full story.

And research continues to reveal more about their remarkable capabilities. Though we tend to consider personal names as uniquely human, emerging research suggests that elephants may have their own version of individual-specific calls. As I observed this herd on the march across a dusty plain in Kenya, it was easy to imagine how individual \"names\" could play a role in maintaining contact and facilitating communication over vast distances. It all adds another intriguing dimension to our understanding of these socially complex animals. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.',\n",

Every few minutes, through the morning stillness, a walrus would suddenly whistle—a sound as loud as a train. This steep, verdant place in the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary often visually reminded me of somewhere in tropical latitudes. Yet Round Island is part of the Arctic tundra biome, home to a lush variety of vegetation—and to this day, one of the most interesting natural ecosystems I've visited. Every summer, thousands of Pacific walruses gather on the island's shores to recuperate after mating season, and thanks to a state-run visitor program, it's one of the best places in the world to see Pacific walruses in the wild.

Kinkajous are not super rare but are very hard to find and photograph. This one is holding onto a balsa flower filled with nectar mixed with rainwater. Silently and hardly moving so as not to frighten off the animals, Lars-Magnus Ejdeholm, my amazing assistant at the time, and I looked for them with our night-vision binoculars. If they showed up, we would be ready with cameras and large flash systems. Lars-Magnus sat in the fork of one branch, and I sat in another, both of us secured with climbing ropes. Kinkajous are sensitive to sound and movement, so we had to be up in the trees several hours before sunset. Some nights the animals turned up, other nights it was silent and dark and the assignment felt pretty hopeless. It was difficult to get any closer to the animals. But after a few weeks it seemed that they were becoming habituated to our presence. Certain animals got used to the camera flash and the weak light from Lars-Magnus’s flashlight. They came closer and stayed longer. On a couple of occasions, everything fell into place. The shy kinkajous finally dared to drink nectar just an arm’s length from the camera.
